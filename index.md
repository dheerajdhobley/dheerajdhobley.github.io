## Introduction
I like working with computers and am interested in science and the scientific method, math, digital animation, web design, synth music and permissionless cryptocurrencies.

## About me
I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering from Monash University. I work on serial-interface devices in gaming and other fun things.

## Hobbies
1. My favourite video game is *Burnout Paradise*. I found *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch* very enjoyable.
2. I like sci-fi movies and series that Netflix would call [cerebral](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/1813), e.g., *Primer*, *Psycho-Pass*.
3. I like hanging out on the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org).
4. I like fiction from *Max Barry*, *Suzanne Collins* and *Dan Brown* and in non-fiction, I like *Bill Gates'* "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster" and *Daniel Kahneman's* "Thinking: Fast and Slow".
5. My favourite online lectures are on [quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jANZxzetPaQ) ([older (maybe better?) version here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61-9PEhRognw5vryrSEVLPr)) and [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7DzL2_Na80) from MIT OpenCourseWare, [Justice and Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY) from Harvard University, and [financial markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQui_3Hpmmc) from YaleCourses.

## Motto
Working hard to make people happy is true worship.

## Statement of Gratitude
I am indebted to my friends and family for their eternal grace and enduring support. I cannot express how grateful I am to them for their help. My happiness lies in theirs.
